WARNING: This project was created in a short period of time and definitely isn't perfect (yet :D)!
This works on most sites, but there are some exceptions!
If you'd like to see any specific improvements or found any bugs, let me know in the "issues".

**Chrome Extension to inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript any web-page.**
Inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript to your favorite web-pages.
Have the changes you make be saved and applied everytime you visit the specified website.

Better than 'inspect element' because It will stay after a reload :D


**How to install?**

Get it in the chrome extension store here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-manipulator/mdhellggnoabbnnchkeniomkpghbekko

Or follow the steps below.
- Download all these files and put them in to a folder.
- Open your chrome browser and click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
- Go to: "More Tools" > "Extensions".
- Enable developer mode in the top right corner.
- Click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner and select the folder.
- Enjoy :D




**How to use?**
- Simple, First open the extension.
- Choose 'JavaScript', 'CSS' or 'HTML'.
- Create a new file by pressing 'new'.
- Write your own code or get some from the examples here: https://github.com/Ruud14/Page-Manipulator/tree/master/examples
- Button functionalities:
    - The 'Reload' Button:
        - Will Reload the current page.
    - The 'Active' checkbox:
        - If on > The code will be run automatically on the pages specified in the 'Active websites' textarea.
        - If off > The code will only run when you press the 'Manipulate' button.
    - The 'Active Websites' textarea:
        - You can specify the websites you want your code to run on here.
    - The 'Matching Pages' dropdown:
        - If 'Exact' > The code will only run when the url of the page is exactly the same as one of the urls in the 'Active Websites' textarea.
        - If 'Recursive' > The code will also run on all sub-pages of the specified urls in the 'Active Websites'.
    - The 'Position on page' dropdown (only with HTML):
        - If 'Top' > The HTML will be added to the top of the page.
        - If 'Bottom' > The HTML will be added to the bottom of the page.
        - If 'Replace' > The html will replace the entire body HTML of the page.
    - The 'Manipulate' or 'Update Manip.' button:
        - Injects the code into the page or updates the injection.
        - **This button also works when the 'Active' checkbox is unchecked.**
    - The 'Remove Manip.' Button:
        - Removes the manipulation from the page.
    - The 'Delete' button:
        - Deletes the current file from the storage.
- You can right click any element on a page to get the css path of that element.

**Functionalities**
- Have HTML, CSS and/or Javascript automatically added to all pages or the pages you specify.
- Run custom CSS **Before** the page is fully loaded so you won't see the origial page first.
- Inject Javascript on the go.
- Add/Remove/Change the HTML and CSS on the go.
- Right click on any element on a page to get the full CSS path.
- Automatically save and sync the scripts you make.

**Fun use cases**:
- Cheat simple games like the t-rex game.
- Fool your friends by showing them something fake on a website.
- Make your own dark-theme for any website.
- Test a website you're working on.
- Whatever you can imagine, be creative :D

**It doesn't work, what now?**:
If the extension button in the top right corner is greyed-out, you can't use it on that page.
- For Javascript:
    - Make sure your code is run at the right moment. Maybe try adding a delay.
    - Check the chrome console for error messages. 

- For CSS:
    - Make sure you are are manipulating the right element. by using "inspect element".
    - Try using '!important'.
- For HTML:
    - Make sure you haven't accidentally set the 'position' dropdown to the wrong position.

**What I learned:**
- The process of making extensions.
- Basics of JavaScript.
- Chrome storage and messaging API.
